# Tambola
The mini project is a Tambola ball draw system which will generate random numbers from 0-100, one at a time. Players will then cross the displayed number in their Tambola ticket(s) if that number is present in the ticket.

The project makes use of Materialize CSS and hence, LICENSE is added as provided by Materialize CSS team.
